# Image-Quality-Metric-Estimation-and-Enhancement
Built a system which estimates the quality of a given 'Retinal Image' and passes it to an enhancement block if it fits in as a normal quality image and rejects it otherwise. Various methods including Image Structural Clustering along with other pattern recognition techniques were implemented to build the above system.
